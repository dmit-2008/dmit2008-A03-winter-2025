/*
  So to get mocks working you need to install
  a few libraries
  - msw (the most popular rest api mock library in js)
  - isomorphic-fetch
    (this is going to fetch the same on the browser and
    locally) This is because "fetch" is different on the
    browser and node the package isomorphic-fetch just
    essentially bridges those differences.
  - jest-fixed-dom
    - next.js they haven't dealt with their testing environment
    well, this is a large issue.
    - people want to test their apps so msw essentially added
    a "polyfill" to esentially add the required missing pieces
    to their testing for mocking rest apis.
    - you have to edit the testEnvironment in jest.config.js
    for this to work.
